"Primary school teachers in Bangladesh joined public sector workers in protests against the interim government on Monday amid growing discontent and political uncertainty in the South Asian country. Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, took over as interim head of the country of 173 million last August after deadly student-led protests forced then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India. Yunus’ administration has faced pressure from civil servants, teachers, political parties and the military as the caretaker government attempts to guide the country through a fragile transition before holding a general election. The government issued an ordinance on Sunday allowing the Ministry of Public Administration to dismiss public servants for misconduct without lengthy procedures, sparking outrage across the bureaucracy. Government employees continued their demonstrations for a third consecutive day on Monday, calling the ordinance “repressive” and demanding its immediate withdrawal. Thousands of teachers in government primary schools also began indefinite leave from work on Monday, demanding a hike in wages. In the face of protests by the employees of National Board of Revenue, the interim government was forced on Sunday to withdraw an order to dissolve the tax body and replace it with two divisions under the finance ministry. The strike was then called off. Political uncertainty also deepened last week after a top student leader said Yunus said he could step down if political parties cannot agree on reforms and an election timeline. Wahiduddin Mahmud, the planning adviser in Yunus’ cabinet, however, said the de-facto prime minister was not quitting. “We are not going anywhere till our job is done,” Mahmud said during the weekend, adding that Yunus acknowledged the obstacles but remained committed to holding a fair election. The interim government has been caught between competing demands for swift general elections and reforms. Yunus has said the elections could be held by June, 2026 while the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has been pushing for polls by December. Bangladesh’s army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, added to the pressure by calling for elections to be held in December during a speech last week, expressing his dissatisfaction over the political situation. Yunus convened a last-minute meeting of his Advisory Council on Saturday and also held talks during the weekend with the country’s main political forces, including the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the student-led National Citizen Party. Leaders of other political parties also met Yunus. “We are in a war-like situation,” Yunus’ press secretary Shafiqul Alam told reporters on Sunday. “After the Awami League’s activities were banned, attempts are on to destabilise us in various ways. We have to get out of this situation.” The registration of Hasina’s Awami League party was suspended this month, effectively barring the party from contesting the next election."
"Rescuers said Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 52 people on Monday, 33 of them in a school-turned-shelter, as European allies ramped up their criticism of Israel. While the war raged on, mediators presented a proposal for a 70-day ceasefire and hostage-release deal to Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian source said. The territory’s civil defence agency said many of the casualties at the school in Gaza City were children, while the Israeli military said the site was housing “key terrorists”. Israel has stepped up a renewed offensive to destroy Hamas, drawing international condemnation as aid trickles in following a blockade since early March that has sparked severe food and medical shortages. It has also triggered international criticism, with European and Arab leaders meeting in Spain calling for an end to the “inhumane” and “senseless” war, while humanitarian groups said the trickle of aid was not nearly enough. In Germany, Chancellor Friedrich Merz voiced unusually strong criticism of Israel, saying: “I no longer understand what the Israeli army is now doing in the Gaza Strip, with what goal.” The impact on Gazan civilians “can no longer be justified”, he added. Nevertheless, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Berlin would continue selling weapons to Israel. In Gaza City, civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said that an early-morning Israeli strike on the Fahmi Al-Jarjawi school, where displaced people were sheltering, killed “at least 33, with dozens injured, mostly children”. The Israeli military said it had “struck key terrorists who were operating within a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control centre embedded in an area”, adding that “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians”. Another strike killed at least 19 people in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, Bassal said. A Palestinian source meanwhile said that mediators proposed a 70-day ceasefire and the release of 10 Israeli hostages alongside some Palestinian prisoners. A Hamas source said shortly after that the group had accepted the proposal for what would be the war’s third truce, saying it came from US envoy Steve Witkoff. The Israeli military said on Monday that over “the past 48 hours, the (air force) struck over 200 targets throughout the Gaza Strip”. It also said it had detected three projectiles launched from Gaza toward communities in Israel Monday, as the country prepared to celebrate Jerusalem Day, an annual event marking its capture of the city’s eastern sector in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. “Two projectiles fell in the Gaza Strip and one additional projectile was intercepted,” it said. Later on Monday, it issued an evacuation order for areas of Khan Yunis, saying they had been the site of rocket launches. The same day, as Arab and European nations gathered to seek an end to the war, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called for an arms embargo on Israel. He also called for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza “massively, without conditions and without limits, and not controlled by Israel”, describing the territory as humanity’s “open wound”. Israel last week partially eased an aid blockade on Gaza that had exacerbated widespread shortages of food and medicine. COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body that coordinates civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said that “107 trucks belonging to the UN and the international community carrying humanitarian aid... were transferred” into Gaza on Sunday. But aid agencies insist that is nowhere near enough, at just a fraction of what was allowed in during a two-month ceasefire. While Israel has restricted aid into Gaza, the war has made growing food next to impossible, with the UN saying on Monday just five percent of Gaza’s farmland was now useable. Meanwhile, Jake Wood, the head of a US-backed group preparing to move aid into Gaza, announced his resignation, saying it was impossible to do his job in line with principles of neutrality and independence. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has vowed to distribute about 300 million meals in its first 90 days of operation, and said in a statement it would begin “direct aid delivery” on Monday. The UN and international aid agencies have said they will not cooperate with GHF and have heavily criticised its plans. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Monday that at least 3,822 people had been killed in the territory since a ceasefire collapsed on March 18, taking the war’s overall toll to 53,977, mostly civilians. Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Militants also took 251 hostages, 57 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 who the Israeli military says are dead."

He will also deliver an address to a distinguished audience at the university. In the evening, the Chief Adviser will attend a community reception hosted by the Bangladesh Embassy in Tokyo and engage with members of the Bangladeshi diaspora, followed by a dinner hosted in his honour by the Bangladesh Ambassador to Japan at Bangladesh House. The Chief Adviser will conclude his visit and depart Tokyo in the morning of 31 May on a Singapore Airlines flight via Singapore, with arrival in Dhaka expected later that night."
"Referring to all eyes on the Army Chief’s statement following Sheikh Hasina’s departure on 5 August, BNP leader Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury questioned, “What’s the problem if the Army Chief now speaks in favour of returning to the democratic process?” Citing the army chief’s proposal as a positive move, the senior BNP leader said, “He spoke about establishing democracy.” Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury made the remarks while addressing an event in the capital’s DRU Auditorium on Monday. “It is not possible to form a unity solely for the benefit of one individual. It is unacceptable to hinder democracy in the name of reform. The BNP spoke about reform seven years ago. Our 27-point agenda, along with those who participated in the simultaneous movement, later evolved into a 31-point agenda through coordination. Therefore, the call for reform is ours. Those who now speak of implementation — this is not originally their idea,"" the BNP leader said. The BNP leader further said, “No one has the right to snatch people’s right to vote. How many of the student leaders who put the interim government in power are still united? When will they achieve popularity and then go into polls? People are not ignorant. They understand the game quite well.” Amir Khasru said, “The longer a non-democratic government holds power, the bigger the control over freedom of speech. The country will return to democratic ways as soon as the government declares a roadmap for the upcoming election. We want an environment where a partisan government can continue to work with the interim government even after the end of their term.” He said people’s sacrifices during the July uprising were not being recognised or remembered properly. “Will it be credible if only a few individuals take the entire credit instead of the unsung heroes of the uprising? It now seems that Hasina fled solely based on a few people's words."" He warned that it would not be good for any one if the nation is divided for one person taking all the credit. “We must accept the history. We must not forget those who were killed or were subjected to torture while in imprisonment.” He further said, “The members of the advisory council were nowhere to be found to give any statement during Sheikh Hasina’s rule. What would happen to the politicians if Hasina was still in power? Some would have been killed or been held in the ‘aynaghar’ (secret detention centre) or been imprisoned for life. However, what the advisers would have been doing? They would be with their own works.”"
"Abu Sayeed Mohammad Kamruzzaman, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC), has been removed from his position. The Ministry of Public Administration disclosed this in a notification issued today, Monday. It reads the official has been transferred from Dhaka North City Corporation and appointed as the director general of the Haor and Wetland Development Department under the Ministry of Water Resources. Abu Sayeed Mohammad Kamruzzaman took over as the CEO of DNCC on 18 February this year. As such, he served the post for three months and eight days in total. Earlier, on 16 April, DNCC chief property official Md Nuruzzaman and chief revenue official Md Moniruzzaman were removed from their posts on the same day. Md Nuruzzaman was appointed the director of the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority, and Md Moniruzzaman was appointed as a deputy secretary at the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Speaking to several DNCC officials, it has been learnt that since taking over he had disagreements with DNCC administrator Mohammad Ejaz several times over different issues relating to DNCC operations. They also had disagreements regarding leasing out the lone permanent cattle market in the city corporation area in Gabtoli. The sudden transfer could be an outcome of these disagreements, the DNCC officials assume."
"Nobel Laureate Professor Abhijit Banerjee on Monday laid emphasis on looking beyond GDP figures to achieve sustainable economic development. “Too much focus is placed on GDP. GDP is high in large countries, but we should be talking about GDP per capita,"" he said while speaking virtually at a seminar titled ""Transforming Development: Building a Culture of Accountability through Evaluation, Auditing and Ethics"". The Economic Relations Division (ERD) of the Ministry of Finance and the New Development Bank's (NDB) Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) Internal Audit Department and Compliance and Investigations Department co-hosted the high-level seminar in the city focused on embedding accountability, evaluation, and integrity at the heart of development projects-key pillars for delivering on Bangladesh's growth priorities. The seminar highlighted NDB's approach to sustainable development through integrated evaluation, audit, and compliance systems. With over 150 participants including senior level policymakers, development experts, private sector leaders and others, it served as a dynamic platform for cross-learning among emerging economies. In his speech, Abhijit Banerjee stressed that the extent to which GDP reaches the poor, versus how much is accumulated by the wealthy, determines the actual reduction in poverty. He said that in countries like Bangladesh and India, a large share of GDP has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the wealthy over the past 30 to 40 years. As a result, poverty reduction has not been significant despite GDP growth, he added. ""If we want to talk about everything, for example, about temperature changes, then GDP alone isn't enough. We need to distinguish income levels, and unfortunately, income inequality has systematically worsened in many countries over the last 30 years,"" he said. ""We must examine who is truly benefiting from the fruits of GDP,"" he added. Economist Abhijit Banerjee also noted that 10 years ago, inflation, exchange rates, and government debt were relatively under control in most countries, which is no longer the case. ""Sustainable economic development now faces many greater questions. Political and environmental challenges are creating survival risks for large firms,"" he said."
"A wave of concern swept over the political arena recently when speculations spread that the chief advisor may resign out of anger and frustration. According to a Prothom Alo report in this connection, a meeting of the advisory council held on 22 May discussed the matters of demonstrations blocking Dhaka city's roads every day, the political parties failing to reach a consensus on reforms and other issues, various quarters not cooperating with the government, and so on. At one point of the discussions the chief advisor raised the issue of not being able to work. He said, nothing tangible has been done about reforms and so what was the point of his staying on. The chief advisor eventually didn't resign, but the issue remains hanging in the air. It has been over nine months, but no progress has been made regarding reforms. Four months have passed since the first six reforms commissions submitted their reports, but implementation has not begun. The political parties have differing stances on the question of certain fundamental reforms. But the responsibility of bringing out a consensus of the issue of reforms lies with the interim government. If the political parties do not cooperate in this regard, the government should clarify the matter and try to mobilise public opinion on important reforms. But does the government have any initiative to take these reforms to the general public and explain their pros and cons? If not, then how will pressure be created on the unwilling political parties regarding fundamental reforms? Apart from the disunity among political parties on the issue of reforms, another major problem is that the actions of the government and its supporters give no indication of reforms. The bureaucracy, police, and judiciary are all functioning as before. Mass lawsuits are still being filed against people. Mass arrests have not stopped. The judiciary is not functioning independently. Meanwhile, there has been no significant improvement in law and order. Highway robberies happen regularly. Mobs are attacking individuals and institutions. Extortion has not stopped. Along with the non-cooperation of various parties, there is also failure on the part of the government.Take street protests, for example. It is natural for people from different classes and professions to have demands. If the government paid proper attention to these demands in a timely manner and tried to resolve them through dialogue, then these groups would not have had to take to the streets, or lay siege to Shahbagh or Jamuna. But the fact is that until and unless there is a sit-in at Shahbagh or Jamuna, the attention of the government is not caught. Political governments have all sorts of mechanisms to listen to these demands and resolve them. But the interim government, even in nine months, has been unable to come up with any such mechanism and so the street blockades continue unabated. The government, rather, is seen to display a biased attitude in many instances. When the National Citizens Party attempted to lay siege to Jamuna, the police behaved tolerantly. However, in the case of others, their behaviour has been aggressive. Such bias erodes public trust in the government. Arrests and baton charges are still being carried out as before to suppress labour movements. On one hand, mobs are being mobilised and achieving their demands with minimal effort, while on the other hand, people from various classes and professions are protesting day after day without receiving any attention from the government. Criminals are being released on bail, while innocent individuals, including women and children from the Bawm community, are being denied bail. There are other problems too. The chief advisor feels that the government does not have full control over the administration, police and the election commission. There are pro-BNP elements everywhere. It is not possible to carry out a fair election under such circumstances. Professor Yunus does not want to take responsibility for such a situation. (Various parties active, advisors silent, Samakal, 24 May 2025) The question is, who made the appointments to the police and the election commission. Without following any transparent and acceptable process, it as the government itself that made the appointments, transfers and promotions in the secretariat and all government institutions, at the behest of BNP, Jamaat, NCP and the Nagorik Committee. So they cannot shirk the responsibility. Before the report of the electoral reform commission was even released, the election commission was formed by the current interim government. At the time, many, including the electoral reform commission itself, had said that the reform recommendations should come first, and only then should the election commission be formed in accordance with those recommendations. But instead, the government went ahead and formed the election commission following the old model, including individuals recommended by the BNP and Jamaat. Immediately after the formation of the interim government, there were widespread transfers and promotions in various positions of the administration. Several organisations had influence behind these decisions. Did the government say at that time that it would not make appointments or transfers in the administration or police based on the preferences of different parties? You can’t plant a tree following the suggestions of the BNP, Jamaat, and NCP, and then expect to reap fruit of your own choosing. The fruit will grow according to the way the tree was planted. Therefore, whatever the administration, judiciary, or election commission does now, the responsibility will ultimately fall on the interim government. Questions are also being raised about whether the interim government is an NCP government or one that represents people of all views and affiliations. The neutrality of the two student advisors in the government has come under scrutiny. BNP has demanded their resignation. In response, NCP has accused the government of favouring BNP and has called for the resignation of three other advisors. Meanwhile, it appears that the far-right groups consider the interim government to be their own. Perhaps it’s not surprising that they think that way. Ever since the government came to power, they have been vandalising shrines, harassing women in public spaces, shutting down fairs, festivals, music and theater events, attacking libraries, and carrying out violence and oppression against various minority and marginalised communities. But the government has taken no strong action to stop these acts. It’s as if there’s a free-for-all going on. It is against this backdrop that BNP and several other political parties are putting pressure on the government regarding the election. Many of them believe that this government represents a specific group. There is a perception that the government shows partiality towards NCP. When it comes to reforms, there is a disconnect between the words and actions of the government and its ally, NCP. The excessive enthusiasm of some government figures over corridors and ports has also raised suspicions. To overcome the current situation, the government must become more sincere about reforms and justice, and that sincerity must be visible to the public. Reforms should not be limited to rhetoric. This must be reflected in the government’s actions. A election date should be announced, and attention must be focused on reforms. The interim government must become, through its actions, not a government for any particular party or group, but a government for all democratic-minded people of the country. * Kallol Mustafa is a writer on power, energy, environment and development economics.

"Bangladesh will seek USD 1 billion soft loan from Japan during the upcoming official visit of Chief Adviser Professor Dr Muhammad Yunus to Tokyo, scheduled for 28-31 May. ""The main focus of this visit is budgetary support,"" said Acting Foreign Secretary Md Ruhul Alam Siddique while addressing a curtain-raiser press briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon. Chief Adviser Yunus is expected to depart Dhaka early Wednesday for the four-day visit, during which he will hold bilateral talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on 30 May, aimed at deepening cooperation across a wide range of strategic areas. ""The formal announcement of the soft loan is expected following the bilateral talks, after which an exchange of notes will be signed,"" Siddique said. Tokyo will accord a red-carpet welcome to the Chief Adviser upon his arrival, including a guard of honour, he said. The Acting Foreign Secretary said the visit will prioritise the enhancement of bilateral relations, with special focus on economic and strategic collaboration. A total of seven Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) are expected to be signed during the visit, covering energy cooperation, human resource development, manpower export, and the establishment of special economic zones. Professor Yunus will also participate in the Nikkei 30th Future of Asia Conference to be held in Tokyo on 29–30 May, where he will deliver a keynote speech in a plenary session. He was invited to the forum by Japanese Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Ikuina Akiko earlier this year. The Chief Adviser is also a recipient of the prestigious Nikkei Asia Prize, awarded in 2004. Highlighting the broader significance of the visit, Siddique said discussions will include a wide range of bilateral and multilateral issues, including trade and investment, political and economic cooperation, security, regional and global developments, and the issue of forcibly displaced Rohingyas from Myanmar. Japan has reiterated its commitment to strengthening engagement with Bangladesh under the Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth Belt (Big-B) initiative and the broader Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy, he said. As part of these initiatives, Japan aims to support high-quality infrastructure projects in Bangladesh and promote the expansion of Japanese manufacturing value chains, he added. Diplomatic sources noted that both countries will seek to further enhance ties under the Japan-Bangladesh Strategic Partnership with an emphasis on people-to-people connectivity, cultural exchanges, and sectoral cooperation. Director General of the East Asia & Pacific Wing Mohammed Nore-Alam and Director General of the Public Diplomacy Wing Shah Asif Rahman also addressed the media."
"A Hamas source said the group had accepted a Gaza ceasefire proposal presented by mediators that reportedly involves the releasing of 10 hostages in two batches and a 70-day truce. The outline of the new potential deal was revealed as Israel ramped up its offensive in the Palestinian territory, and follows previous rounds of talks that have failed to reach a breakthrough ever since a two-month ceasefire fell apart in mid-March. ""Hamas has agreed to the new proposal by US envoy Steve Witkoff, which the movement received from mediators,"" the Hamas source told AFP. The deal, they added, included ""a 70-day truce in exchange for the release of 10 hostages in two batches, and during the truce, negotiations would begin on a permanent ceasefire with American guarantees"". Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, was involved in the negotiations that led to the last ceasefire deal. Another Palestinian source close to the negotiations told AFP the new proposal laid out ""the release of 10 living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a 70-day truce, a partial (Israeli) withdrawal from the Gaza Strip (and) the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners"". The source added that mediators presented the proposal ""over the past few days"". The United States, Egypt and Qatar have all had a hand in mediating the ceasefire talks throughout the war. The proposal, the second source said, would involve the release of ""five living Israeli hostages during the first week of the agreement's implementation, and five others before the end of the truce period"".Israel had said last week that it was recalling its senior Gaza hostage negotiators from talks in Doha ""for consultation"", while leaving some lower-level members of its team in the Qatari capital. Israel has recently intensified its campaign in Gaza, calling it an ""expansion of the battle"" against Hamas. The last ceasefire between the sides fell apart amid disagreements over how to move forward, with Israel resuming its operations in Gaza on 18 March. On 2 March, Israel imposed a total aid blockade on the territory that it said was aimed at forcing concessions from Hamas, with UN agencies since warning it has created critical shortages of food, clean water, fuel and medicines. Israel partially eased the blockade last week, and aid trucks have begun to trickle back into Gaza, though humanitarian groups have urged it to allow more supplies to enter faster."
"Referring to the ongoing protests at the Secretariat, National Board of Revenue (NBR), and Chattogram Port over various demands, National Citizen Party (NCP) senior joint chief coordinator Abdul Hannan Masud issued a stern warning. He said, “To those striking today at the Secretariat, NBR, or the port — I’m telling you, the revolution will happen there too.” Hannan Masud took to social media platform Facebook on Monday to issue this warning. Earlier in the morning, while attending a party event in Chattogram, Hasnat Abdullah, the NCP’s chief organiser for the southern region, also issued a harsh warning. He said that if government employees obstruct the government's work or issue threats, the people themselves will find alternatives. If government officials and employees try to hold the government hostage by resisting reforms, the outcome will not be good. Hannan Masud wrote on Facebook in the afternoon, “To those striking today at the Secretariat, NBR, or the port — I’m telling you, the revolution will happen there too. You are demanding the freedom to continue corruption and looting, but you won’t get that after the post-2024 period. You have been accomplices in every abduction, murder, corruption, and money laundering incident throughout Hasina’s entire rule. Do not think you have gotten away. Let me repeat: there is no way you will get away. The government must immediately remove these corrupt individuals and take action through an independent commission after a fair investigation.” It is to mention that the Advisory Council approved the draft of the Government Service (Amendment) Ordinance last Thursday. The amendment allows for quicker and easier disciplinary actions against public servants. Government officers and employees have objected, claiming it contradictory  to the constitution. According to them, it is a black law and repressive. Government officials and staff had gone on protest at the secretariat since Sunday. Despite their objections, the ordinance was issued on Sunday night after receiving the president’s approval. Meanwhile, NBR employees went on sit-ins and pen-down strikes demanding the withdrawal of the Revenue Policy and Revenue Management Ordinance, 2025, which splits the NBR, since the night of 12 May, the day of the issuing ordinance. As the government promised to meet their demands, the protesting NBR officers and employees called off all strikes on Sunday night. However, the platform that is leading the protests NBR Reform Unity Council has given the government a three-day ultimatum to remove the chairman of the organisation. Meanwhile, the Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal held protest rallies and demonstrations against the decision to hand over the New Mooring Container Terminal at Chattogram Port to foreign companies."
